# File-Organizer
This Python code organizes files in a specified directory based on their file extensions and moves them to appropriate folders. It is a helpful utility to keep your downloads folder or any other directory organized.
To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your system. The script is compatible with Python 3.x.

USAGE
Open the script file file_sorting.py in a text editor or Python IDE of your choice.

Modify the extensions dictionary to add or remove file extensions as per your requirements. You can categorize files into different types such as images, videos, music, documents, etc. Each category should have a list of corresponding file extensions.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script file is located.

Run the script using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python file_sorting.py
The script will scan the current directory (in this case, "E:\downloads") and move each file to the appropriate subdirectory based on its extension.

If a subdirectory doesn't exist, the script will create it automatically.
